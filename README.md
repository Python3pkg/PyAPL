# PyAPL
A python implementation of the APL programming language

NOTE: This is in no way a complete project. So far, it only works with very simple code samples. There is a LOT of features and testing that must be added

Interactive mode and file mode are yet to be implemented.

Example implementation:

    from pyAPL.src import *
    print(apl('(÷5-7)+÷15'))
    print(apl('(÷1 253 3) - (÷3 2 1)'))
